        <h1>Carlos Hern√°ndez? Who that?</h1>

        <p className="">I'm a developer from Venezuela. I'm currently based in Colombia. I'm {myAge()} years old.</p>
        <p><a href="https://carlos815.github.io/portfolio/">Link to my portfolio</a></p>
        <p className="">
          I was actually an economist, but pivoted to development during the pandemic
        </p>

        <p>I have worked with React, Flutter and even Python for some data analysis, but I mostly gravitate towards React.</p>
        <p>I&#39;m the creator of <a href="laslucas.com">Las Lucas</a>, a completely free website that compiles the different exchange rates in Venezuela. It has over 10.000 visits each month.</p>
        <p>The site uses multiple web scrappers to keep itself updated with the many <em>officialish</em> exchange rates (long story) and shows it with a very simple interface. That way people don't have to scour social media sites to get updates multiple times a day, which is a challenge for people that are not tech savvy and/or have slow connection.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m good at writing chronicles. As in, I-should-be-doing-that-for-a-living-instead-of-programming kind of good, with multiple publications in big sites like the NTY and the Washington Post.</p>
        <p>I learned English by playing Zelda and Star Fox in the Nintendo 64, which officially makes me a Certified Nerd‚Ñ¢.</p>
        <p>I&#39;m very into metal music. I used to play the keyboard in <a href="https://soundcloud.com/neutrinia-banda">a power metal band</a> back in college. I kinda&#39; miss that.</p>
        <p>I like exercising, specially running, although as a Certified Nerd‚Ñ¢, I admit that screwing around with data sheets about my performance in Excel was half of the fun. Right now I&#39;m into CrossFit, which I&#39;m terrible at, but it&#39;s still lots of fun (what up 6 am squat?).</p>

        <p>For now this section is better read on <a href="https://carlos815.github.io/portfolio/">my portfolio page</a> which has some nice illustrations, and a handy graph of all of my tech stack. I&#39;m in the process of migrating all of that to this new blog, so this section will eventually be it&#39;s own page. For now, it&#39;s this very lame list.</p>
